### Problem

Inflation in Nigeria today keeps devaluing the population's hard earned money coupled with the Nigerian government's recent policy and ban. The country has not been attractive to foreign investors or trade of late which keeps making the Nigerian Naira devalue more against the US dollars.

In the span of 12 months we have seen the Naira devalue drastically from **$1 ~ 360 NGN** to **$1 ~ 500 NGN**.  Which means, a savings of **500,000 NGN** equivalent of **$1,389** then, now worths about **$1,000** or a little more than that. It's frustrating for an average Nigerian to see their savings dwindle such a short time.

The emergence of crypto currencies has enabled a few Nigerians to easily convert their savings from Fiat to stable coins such as Dai, BUSD or USDC but only a few people have the technical know-how to do so.

### Solution

Piggy.Fi is a savings platform <u>without the need of an ethereum client</u>, that allows savings using Fiat (NGN), which are in turn converted into stable coins via a P2P market and staked on Lending platforms such as Compound &amp; Venus protocol to earn interest. Upon withdrawal of savings as stable coins, it can be converted back to Fiat via a P2P market.
